# StockScraper

Overview
  The intent of this project was to develop a way to scrape stock data including a list of tickers, daily time series data as well as metrics from the website MarketBeat (includes employee number, cash flow statements, and fundamental research of the company). The modules to pull this data are created in the ScraperRo file while the main script is used to make a call to the database to pull existing data. The data can then subsequently used to perform various analytical techniques for financial analysis.
  
  Steps to run: run scraperRo after installing postgres sql then run main script.
